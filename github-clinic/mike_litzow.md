# The power of open science: publishing with GitHub

We can use GitHub to publish on the open web. GitHub supports Markdown text formatting. For example, with Markdown:

We can make words **bold** or *italic*.

## We can make headers.

We can make lists that are automagically numbered – *note that lists need a carriage return before list items!*

1. tanners
1. opies
1. red king crab

[Markdown](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) can also make hyperlinks using the `[]()` pattern: you put words to hyperlink in `[]` and the URL in `()`. For example:

> [This twitter thread](https://twitter.com/allison_horst/status/1287772985630191617) describes the palmerpenguins R package. 
Learn more on the [palmerpenguins webpage](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins).

We can include an image with the same `[]()` pattern, but note the preceding exclamation point: `![]()`. *Note that from the browser, you'll need an image with an existing url.* 

Here's a different figure.
